# Terraform Dynamic API Provider

This repository contains Terraform provider implementations that fetch data from any REST API and expose it as a Terraform data source. It demonstrates three different approaches to handling API responses:

- **Basic REST API Response Handling** – Parses structured JSON and stores specific fields.
- **Dynamic JSON Handling** – Allows dynamic JSON responses with key-value pairs.
- **Dynamic Struct Generation** – Uses reflection to create Go structs dynamically based on the API response.

## 🚀 When to Use Which Implementation?

| Approach                      | Use Case |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic REST API Handling**    | When the API response structure is **fixed and known**. |
| **Dynamic JSON Handling**      | When the API returns **varying JSON structures dynamically**. |
| **Dynamic Struct Handling**    | When you need **strongly typed access** but don't know the structure beforehand. |
